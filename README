Developing a simple 1-to-N pipe structure just to prove to myself that it is not that tough to implement.
Will contain a very simple parser to parse a command similar to : 

        $ npipe "command1 with args" "command2 with args" "command3 with args" ...

the first command is the only writer, and all the other commands read from whatever the first command has written, so to say, a 1-to-N pipe is set up between command1 and command2, command3, ... so on.
