The parser is partially in place, can parse a command of the form 

        "command arg1 arg2 arg3 ..."

and execute the command with those args.

Can currently support any number of commands of the type : 

        npipe "command1 arg11 arg12 arg13..." "command2 arg21 arg22 arg23 ..." ...

Most handy for multiple searches, simultaneous redirection to multiple files etc, use the utils/fcat utility for dumping the standard input to a file. The program takes the output file name as the only argument
